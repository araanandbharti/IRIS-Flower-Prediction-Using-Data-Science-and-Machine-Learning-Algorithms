# IRIS-Flower-Classification-Using-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
<h2> About Iris flower Dataset</h2>
The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) from measurements of sepals and petals' length and width. 
It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The central goal here is to design a model that makes useful classifications for new flowers or, in other words, one which exhibits good generalization.

This data set became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines. This makes the data set a good example to explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised techniques in data mining

# DATA SCIENCE 

-> Extraction on IRIS Dataset (From Sci-Kit learn dataset).                              
-> Cleaning the data (Dropping or replacing the ambiguous data ). 
-> Data Transformation (Changing the type and values of data).                                                                                                           
-> Clustering the data  (Dividing the dataset into different datasets).                                                                               
-> Data Visualization (Using the different type maps with different parameter).                                                                    
-> Splitting the data into test data and train data.                                                     
# MACHINE LEARNING

-> Creating the prediction Model.                                                                  
-> Training and testing of Model.                                                         
-> Finding Accuracy of different model.                                                                       
-> Comparing the different model with confusing matrix.

Class Distribution : 33.3% for each of three classes

# Observation
Using Sepal-Length & Sepal-Width features
We can only distinguish Setosa flower from others 
Separating Versicolor & Virginica is much harder as they have considerable overlap
Hence, Sepal-Length & Sepal-Width features only work well for Setosa

Using Petal-Length & Petal-Width features
We can distinguish Setosa, Versicolor & Virginica fairly
There are slightly overlap of Versicolor & Virginica.
Graph shows that Petal (Length and Width) features are best contributor for Iris Species as compare to Sepal (Length and Width)
